## Description

This project was part of the Software Engineering 1 course, where we were tasked with forming a team of 6 people to develop a video game called "The Switcher." The game revolves around identifying and forming shapes on a board using movement cards.
We used React for the front-end and FastAPI for the back-end.
The communication between the client and server was done via a REST API and WebSockets. The client would send a fetch request whenever the user wanted to perform an action or when the server notified the client through WebSocket about any events.
This project demonstrates my ability to work in a team, utilizing tools like Jira and Git. It also highlights my algorithmic skills, which were crucial for identifying shapes on the board, as well as my ability to take a project from scratch and successfully complete it.
While there are many improvements we could make, we were proud to receive a grade of 10 for the project.
