## Description

This was a summer project inspired by my Operating Systems course and my daily use of tiling window managers. I decided to create my own status bar for SwayWM.
I also chose to use Rust—a language I was unfamiliar with—as a way to learn it through this project. While I achieved my goal, I must admit that Rust is a challenging language, and I still have much to learn. I haven’t revisited it since then, as I’m currently focused on learning Golang.
What made the process even more demanding was having to use a framework, gtk-rs, which meant I was learning both Rust and the framework simultaneously.
Despite these challenges, I am very proud of the result. It’s a piece of software I use daily, and I must say it has never crashed (which likely wouldn’t have been the case if I had chosen a language like C).
Through this project, I learned concepts like IPC and asynchronous operations, as well as applied knowledge from my studies, such as threads, process forking, and more.
